# Simpsons-Method-
This project simply implements the Simpson method for approximating definite integrals using a C++ Simpson class. Methods are defined for the 'integral' limits, as well as the actual implementation both using a default function and allowing for user input. A setter method for setting the number of intervals is also implemented, ensuring an even input. The result is then checked against the SciPy Python libraries Quad function for integral value accuracy. 

A PDF generated usign Latex is also included, giving a brief description of the method both matematically and algorithmically.
